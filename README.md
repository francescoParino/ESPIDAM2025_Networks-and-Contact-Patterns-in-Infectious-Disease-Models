# ESPIDAM (2025) - Networks and Contact Patterns in Infectious Disease Models
Code for *Practical on the Use and Analysis of Mobility Data* and *Practical on Modeling Spatial Transmission*

## Getting Started
We will use Python with notebooks for interactive coding. Here's a quick setup guide:

**Option 1 (Install Jupyter Lab)**  
1) If Jupyter isn't already on your system, start by downloading Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.  
2) Once Anaconda is installed, open Anaconda Navigator and launch JupyterLab.  
3) Install the required libraries with either `conda install pandas numpy matplotlib geopandas statsmodels` or `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib geopandas statsmodels` in your terminal or command prompt.
4) Download and try to run the test notebook present in this repository. 

**Option 2 (Use Google Colab – no local installation required)**  
You can run the notebooks directly in your browser using Google Colab. 
To test it:  
1)  Open: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_K4Jp0o2yOrQ0lXyIyARuT8_pBSrKkq/view?usp=sharing  
2) Sign in to your Google account if you haven’t already 
3) Click "*Open in Colab*" at the top  
4) Go to *File > Save a copy in Drive* to make your own editable version  
5) Run the code cells and try editing the notebook

## Labs
Files and links for the lessons will be provided soon.
